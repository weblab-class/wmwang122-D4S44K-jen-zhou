# Identify: The Quizbowl Style Guess-the-Song

## How to Login

We are currently in developer mode with the Spotify API, so you will have to be whitelisted in order to play the game. Hopefully, this will change as soon as possible.

## How to Play

Identify is heavily inspired by Quizbowl and Quizbowl-style games. Players can make and join lobbies where the host will queue music. The music will then play one song at a time and players have to buzz as fast as possible to try to guess the song. Choose songs from your playlists, available genre seeds, song select, or popular music at the time!

Together, people from all around the world can learn about each other's music tastes and connect over the common language of music.
